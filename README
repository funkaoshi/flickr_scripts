These are some scripts I use to interact with Flickr. This is probably way too
niche to be useful to anyone else, but might serve as an example of how to use
Flickraw, which is fucking awesome.

flickr_auth.rb is a class that encapsulates connecting to flickr, pulling auth
information from a yaml file. It is probably the most useful of everything here.
